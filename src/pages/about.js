      <h1>Hello<span>.</span></h1>
      <p><b>Iâ€™m Sarah Kirby, a front-end developer and designer from New Zealand who has recently moved to London.</b></p>
      <p>A creative at heart, I studied design for three years and went on to study web development. This is where I found my place, being creative in a technical way.</p>

      <p>I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can further develop my skills in modern web technologies such as React & Sass, and help build beautiful, interactive, user-centered applications.</p>
